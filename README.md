# iGPS++
A modern course selector for universities featuring an AI Assistant for personalized course recommendations.

## üöÄ About

### Inspiration and Concept
iGPS++ emerged as a response to the inherent limitations of traditional university course selectors. It is designed to provide a comprehensive solution that integrates an intuitive course selection interface with an intelligent assistant offering personalized academic recommendations. Our homepage functions as a centralized hub for all essential information, while a dedicated page connects users directly with the AI assistant.

### Development Process, Challenges, and Insights
The development of iGPS++ began with a brainstorming session to define key functional and aesthetic requirements. Responsibilities were then divided among front-end development, database management, and AI integration. While this initial division of labor presented challenges in synchronizing independently developed modules, these issues were resolved through a couple hours of integration coupled with continuous communication. This iterative process not only improved the reliability and maintainability of the system, but also helped us appreciate the importance of collaborative problem solving.
